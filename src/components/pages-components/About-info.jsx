      <h2>The Story of DevTalk Academy</h2>
      <section className="introduction">
      <p>
      DevTalk Academy began its journey in 2010 with the dream of creating a place where everyone could learn foreign languages in a comfortable and inspiring environment. The academy was founded by two friends, Anna and Michael, who, while traveling the world, realized the importance of speaking different languages for both personal and professional growth.

      <h2>The Early Days</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, it was a small language club in their hometown. The first classes were held in a cozy room adorned with world maps and phrases in dozens of languages. Anna, a professional educator, developed a unique teaching methodology that combined interactive exercises, real-life practice, and a personalized approach to each student. Michael, on the other hand, poured his energy into advancing technology, creating an online platform that allowed language learning from anywhere in the world.

      <h2>Our Mission Today</h2>
      <p>
        Today, DevTalk Academy offers courses for all levels, from beginners to advanced learners, and helps students not only master a language but also immerse themselves in the cultures of the countries where it is spoken. The academy takes pride in its mission: to help people unlock their potential through language learning.
