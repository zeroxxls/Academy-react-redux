#Info about Project
I developed this project as part of my coursework at my Ukrainian college. The task was to build a multi-page, responsive web platform for a language academy to sell its language courses, provide lesson viewing, allow user registration on the website, and enable users to enroll in courses and view the courses they have already registered for.

During the development process, I gained an understanding of working with the server-side of the application, databases, and further practiced React. Overall, the project still requires improvements, as many features are not fully implemented yet. However, it is a solid project for developing my skills.
